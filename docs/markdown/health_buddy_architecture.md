## Component Architecture

### Microservices Design Patterns

The Health Buddy system employs several proven microservices design patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and resilience. The architecture follows the single responsibility principle, with each service having a clearly defined domain and set of responsibilities that align with specific business capabilities.

The API Gateway pattern centralizes cross-cutting concerns including authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and request routing. This pattern simplifies client interactions by providing a single entry point while enabling backend services to focus on their core business logic without implementing common infrastructure concerns.

The Database per Service pattern ensures that each microservice owns its data and database schema, preventing tight coupling between services and enabling independent evolution of data models. This pattern supports the use of different database technologies optimized for specific service requirements while maintaining data consistency through well-defined service interfaces.

The Event-Driven Architecture pattern enables loose coupling between services through asynchronous messaging and event publishing. Services publish events when significant state changes occur, allowing other services to react to these events without direct coupling. This pattern supports eventual consistency and enables complex workflows that span multiple services.

The Circuit Breaker pattern protects services from cascading failures by monitoring the health of downstream dependencies and temporarily stopping requests to failing services. This pattern improves system resilience by preventing failure propagation and enabling graceful degradation when external dependencies are unavailable.

The Saga pattern manages distributed transactions across multiple services by coordinating a series of local transactions with compensating actions for rollback scenarios. This pattern enables complex business workflows that span multiple services while maintaining data consistency without requiring distributed transactions.

### Service Communication Patterns

Inter-service communication in the Health Buddy system employs both synchronous and asynchronous patterns depending on the specific requirements of each interaction. Synchronous communication is used for real-time operations that require immediate responses, while asynchronous communication is used for operations that can be processed eventually or that involve complex workflows.

RESTful APIs provide the primary synchronous communication mechanism between services, using HTTP/HTTPS protocols with JSON payloads. REST APIs are designed following OpenAPI specifications to ensure consistent interface design and enable automatic documentation generation and client code generation.

GraphQL APIs are employed for complex data retrieval scenarios where clients need to fetch related data from multiple services in a single request. GraphQL provides efficient data fetching capabilities and reduces the number of round trips required for complex user interface requirements.

Message queues using Apache Kafka provide reliable asynchronous communication for event-driven workflows and data synchronization between services. Kafka's distributed architecture and durability guarantees ensure that important health data events are not lost and can be processed reliably even during system failures.

gRPC is used for high-performance internal service communication where low latency and efficient serialization are important. gRPC provides strongly typed interfaces and efficient binary serialization that improves performance for internal service interactions while maintaining type safety.

WebSocket connections enable real-time bidirectional communication for features like live chat support, real-time health monitoring alerts, and collaborative features. WebSocket connections are managed through dedicated connection management services that handle scaling and load balancing for real-time communications.

### Data Consistency and Transaction Management

Data consistency in the Health Buddy system is managed through a combination of strong consistency within service boundaries and eventual consistency across service boundaries. This approach balances the need for data integrity with the scalability and availability requirements of a distributed system.

Within individual services, ACID transactions ensure strong consistency for operations that must be atomic. Database transactions are used to maintain data integrity for complex operations that involve multiple related data changes within a single service domain.

Across service boundaries, eventual consistency is achieved through event-driven synchronization and compensating transactions. Services publish events when data changes occur, and other services subscribe to these events to maintain synchronized views of relevant data.

The Outbox pattern ensures reliable event publishing by storing events in the same database transaction as the business data changes. A separate process reads events from the outbox table and publishes them to the message queue, ensuring that events are never lost even if the publishing process fails.

Distributed transaction coordination is avoided in favor of saga patterns that break complex transactions into a series of local transactions with compensating actions. This approach provides better scalability and availability while maintaining business-level consistency through careful workflow design.

Data versioning and schema evolution strategies ensure that data consistency is maintained as the system evolves over time. Services implement backward-compatible data formats and migration strategies that enable rolling updates without data corruption or service disruption.

### Error Handling and Resilience

The Health Buddy system implements comprehensive error handling and resilience patterns to ensure reliable operation even when individual components fail. These patterns are designed to provide graceful degradation and quick recovery from various failure scenarios.

The Retry pattern with exponential backoff handles transient failures by automatically retrying failed operations with increasing delays between attempts. This pattern is particularly important for external integrations where temporary network issues or service unavailability can cause intermittent failures.

The Circuit Breaker pattern prevents cascading failures by monitoring the health of downstream services and temporarily stopping requests to services that are experiencing high failure rates. Circuit breakers automatically reset after a configured period, allowing services to recover without manual intervention.

The Bulkhead pattern isolates different types of operations to prevent resource exhaustion in one area from affecting other system functions. For example, user-facing operations are isolated from background data processing to ensure that batch operations don't impact real-time user interactions.

Timeout and deadline management ensures that operations don't hang indefinitely when downstream services are slow or unresponsive. Appropriate timeouts are configured for different types of operations based on their expected response times and user experience requirements.

Health checks and monitoring enable automatic detection of service failures and trigger appropriate recovery actions. Health checks monitor both service availability and business logic correctness to ensure that services are not only running but also functioning properly.

Graceful shutdown procedures ensure that services can be stopped and restarted without losing data or corrupting ongoing operations. Services implement shutdown hooks that complete in-flight requests and persist any necessary state before terminating.
