## Introduction and Scope

### Document Purpose

This Functional Requirements Document (FRD) provides detailed technical specifications for the Health Buddy AI Agent system, translating the high-level product requirements outlined in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) into specific, measurable, and implementable functional requirements. The document serves as the primary technical reference for development teams, quality assurance engineers, system architects, and project managers involved in building the Health Buddy platform.

The FRD defines the precise behavior, inputs, outputs, and processing requirements for each system component, ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what the system must do and how it should perform. This document bridges the gap between product vision and technical implementation, providing the detailed specifications necessary for accurate development estimation, system design, and quality validation.

### Scope and Boundaries

The functional requirements encompass all core Health Buddy AI Agent capabilities including conversational AI interfaces, health data management, medication tracking, document processing, healthcare provider integration, and privacy protection mechanisms. The scope includes both user-facing features and backend system components necessary to support the complete Health Buddy experience across multiple platforms and devices.

The requirements cover integration points with external systems including healthcare providers, pharmacy systems, wearable devices, and third-party health services, while maintaining clear boundaries around system responsibilities and external dependencies. The document specifies requirements for data import and export capabilities, ensuring that Health Buddy can operate effectively within the broader healthcare ecosystem while maintaining user control over health information.

Security and privacy requirements are integrated throughout all functional specifications, reflecting the critical importance of protecting sensitive health information and maintaining user trust. The requirements address both technical security measures and user-facing privacy controls, ensuring comprehensive protection of personal health data.

Performance and scalability requirements are specified to ensure that Health Buddy can deliver responsive user experiences while supporting growth from initial deployment to large-scale operation serving millions of users. The requirements include specific performance targets, scalability thresholds, and reliability standards that guide system architecture and implementation decisions.

### Requirement Classification

Functional requirements are classified using the MoSCoW prioritization method, with each requirement designated as Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, or Won't Have for the initial release. This classification helps development teams focus on core functionality while providing a clear roadmap for future enhancements and feature additions.

Must Have requirements represent core functionality that is essential for Health Buddy to provide basic value to users and meet fundamental product objectives. These requirements form the minimum viable product and must be implemented in the initial release.

Should Have requirements represent important functionality that significantly enhances user experience and system value but is not absolutely critical for initial operation. These requirements are prioritized for early implementation following the core Must Have features.

Could Have requirements represent valuable enhancements that improve user experience or system capabilities but can be deferred to later releases without significantly impacting core functionality or user satisfaction.

Won't Have requirements represent functionality that has been explicitly excluded from the current scope, either due to resource constraints, technical limitations, or strategic decisions to focus on core capabilities.

## System Overview

### Architecture Overview

The Health Buddy AI Agent employs a microservices architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and security. The system is composed of multiple independent services that communicate through well-defined APIs, enabling independent development, deployment, and scaling of different system components.

The core architecture includes a conversational AI service that handles natural language processing and generation, a health data management service that stores and processes user health information, a document processing service that extracts information from medical documents, an integration service that manages connections with external systems, and a notification service that handles medication reminders and health alerts.

Each service is designed with clear separation of concerns, ensuring that changes to one component do not impact others and that the system can evolve incrementally over time. The architecture supports both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns, enabling real-time user interactions while supporting background processing for complex analytics and data processing tasks.

Data persistence is managed through a combination of relational databases for structured health information, document stores for unstructured data such as medical documents and images, and time-series databases for health metrics and monitoring data. This multi-database approach optimizes performance and scalability for different types of health information while maintaining data consistency and integrity.

### Technology Stack

The Health Buddy platform is built using modern, proven technologies that provide the performance, security, and scalability required for a health information system. The backend services are implemented using Python with FastAPI for high-performance API development, leveraging the extensive Python ecosystem for machine learning, natural language processing, and health data analysis.

The conversational AI components utilize state-of-the-art large language models fine-tuned for health-related conversations, with additional specialized models for medical document processing, symptom analysis, and health insight generation. The AI infrastructure is designed to support both cloud-based and edge computing deployment models, enabling responsive user interactions while maintaining privacy protections.

Frontend applications are developed using React for web interfaces and React Native for mobile applications, providing consistent user experiences across platforms while enabling platform-specific optimizations. The user interface components are built using a design system that ensures accessibility, consistency, and maintainability across all user touchpoints.

Data storage utilizes PostgreSQL for relational data, MongoDB for document storage, and InfluxDB for time-series health metrics. Redis provides caching and session management capabilities, while Elasticsearch enables fast, comprehensive search across all health information.

Cloud infrastructure is deployed on major cloud platforms with multi-region support for performance and disaster recovery. Container orchestration using Kubernetes enables efficient resource utilization and automatic scaling based on demand patterns.

### Security Architecture

Security is implemented through multiple layers of protection including network security, application security, data encryption, and access controls. All communications between system components and with external systems use TLS encryption with certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

Application-level security includes input validation, output encoding, and protection against common web application vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and cross-site request forgery. API security is implemented through OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for user authentication and JWT tokens for session management.

Data encryption is implemented at multiple levels including encryption at rest for all stored data, encryption in transit for all data communications, and field-level encryption for the most sensitive health information. Encryption keys are managed through dedicated key management services with regular rotation and multi-factor authentication for administrative access.

Access controls implement the principle of least privilege, with role-based access controls that ensure users and system components can only access the minimum information necessary for their functions. Audit logging captures all access to health information, providing comprehensive tracking for security monitoring and compliance reporting.
